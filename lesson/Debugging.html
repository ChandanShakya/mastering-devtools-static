      <p>
        If you&#39;ve programmed in another language, step through debugging may
        already be familiar to you! But we&#39;ll cover it here for the folks
        that haven&#39;t seen it before.

        The basic idea is that you can pick a line in your code and highlight
        it. Whenever that line is about to be executed, the browser will instead
        <strong>pause</strong> the execution of the app. Leaving you free to
        poke around in it&#39;s current state for as long as you&#39;d like.
      </p>

        Think about breakpoints like a ultra powerful <code>console.log</code>!
        Instead of just printing out a single expression, you can spend
        unlimited time logging unlimited expressions in a stateless environment.
      </p>
      <p>In this lesson we&#39;ll learn how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set and activate breakpoints</li>
        <li>Use the <code>debugger</code> keyword</li>
        <li>Walk the call stack</li>
        <li>Set conditional breakpoints</li>
        <li>Set XHR breakpoints</li>
      </ul>
